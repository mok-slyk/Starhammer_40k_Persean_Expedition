shpe_fury,SHIP,"Flexible and well-armed, the Fury is the Imperial Navy's main Interceptor craft. While it can also attack larger ships it lacks the punch to truly threaten them, but excells at destroying torpedos and strikecraft.

While it is larger and heavier and heavier than most fightercraft, including its predecessor, the Wrath, the Fury handles suprisingly well and can easily match the speed of the larger Starhawk-Bombers it was designed to escort in battle.

",,,,
shpe_starhawk,SHIP,"Sturdy and heavily armed, the Starhawk carries both bombs and missiles, making it a threat to much large warhships, especially if their shields are down. While it is also capable of defending itself against missiles and other fighters, it fares best with an escort.",,,,
shpe_defiant,SHIP,"The lightest carrier in the imperial fleet, the defiant lacks the firepower of a proper battlecarrier but can bolster the fighter capabilities of larger fleets.

Defiants are the rarest ship of the Voss triumvirate as they are seen as too vulnerable to operate on their own, nonetheless they are a powerful tool in the hands of a capable admiral and have proven themselves especially against fleets lacking strikecraft of their own.",,,,
shpe_endurance,SHIP,"Essentially an Endeavour with lance batteries in place of macrocannons, the Endurance can punch through even heavy armor but can struggle with shielded targets.

A common Imperial Navy practise is to pair up an Edurance with one to three Endeavours, creating a powerful squadron that can handily deal with much larger opponents.",,,,
shpe_endeavour,SHIP,"While lacking the speed of other light cruisers, the Endeavour has the firepower and durability to hold its own in a pitched battle, making them ideal as heavy escorts or convoy flagships.

The cheapest and most common of the Voss triumvirate, the Endeavour is often employed by Imperial fleets to replace lost cruisers as a campaign drags on and larger vessels come into short supply.",,,,
shpe_lunar,SHIP,"Flexible and powerful, the Lunar works well in almost any fleet composition and at all ranges of engagement. Larger Imperial fleets will often feature multiple Lunars for their sheer flexibility.

Lunar cruisers are not only powerful but also cheap and easy to produce, allowing even worlds that could not normally construct full-blown cruisers to build them with only rudimentary orbital works. Because of this, Lunars are the most common type of cruiser in the Imperium and maybe even in the galaxy at large.

",,,,
shpe_gothic,SHIP,"A familliar sight throughout the galaxy, the Gothic features one of the largest lance broadsides in the Imperium, allowing it to quickly destroy even larger opponents if given the chance. Due to its lack of macrobatteries the Gothic works best if supported by other warhsips, allowing it to bring the full force of its lances to bear.

The Gothic is the second most common Imperial cruiser after the Lunar and is commonly used in larger fleet engagements, where if properly supported it can threaten even grand cruisers and battleships.",,,,
shpe_dictator,SHIP,"Originally developed from damaged Lunars for Orbital assaults, the Dictator has since become an ubiquitous and capable battlecarrier.

While the Dictator was originally an experimental retrofit, it has since become one of the main cruisers of the Imperial Navy, often being used as the flagship of larger anti-piracy patrols for its abillity to easily deal with small to medium sized enemies.

",,,,
shpe_dominator,SHIP,"Designed and built around its prow-mounted novacannon, the Dominator is the lightes Imperial Navy vessel to employ this type of terrifying artillery. While it excels al long ranged fire support, the Dominator can also hold its own at knivefighting distances due to its massive macrobattery broadsides.

Most Dominators are constructed and deployed in the Ultima Segmentum, making them very rare in the rest of Imperial space.",,,,
shpe_armageddon,SHIP,"Typically created from the hulks of ruined Lunar cruisers, the Armageddon is a relatively recent innovation for the Imperial Navy, featuring devastating firepower while being comparatively cheap to produce.

Due to their somewhat improvised nature, Armageddon Battlecruisers have suprisingly cramped internals while requiring a vast amount of crew, making them rare in expeditionary fleets and the possesion of rogue traders. For the Imperial Navy however, these downsides are negligible and the Armageddon is probably the most common battlecruiser in the Imperium.",,,,
shpe_mars,SHIP,"The ultimalte ""all rounder"" of the Imperial Navy, the Mars-Battlecruiser features a combination of Lance weapons and Macrobatteries, fighter bays and the devastation novacannon, all on the frame of a cruiser. While it can hold its own in most combat scenarios, the Mars excells in a long-ranged support role, pummeling enemies at range with bombers and nova shells.

Due to changing navy doctrine, Mars Battlecruisers are only produced in very limited quantities nowadays. Nonetheless both navy admirals and rogue traders favor the Mars for its versatility and long ranged power.",,,,
shpe_overlord,SHIP,"A combat ship in its purest form, the Overlord relies on uncomplicated macrobatteries and torpedos, supllementing them with dorsal lances to cut through enemy armor.

While it is one of the oldest Imperial battlecruiser designs, the Overlord still finds heavy use in the Imperial navy, as it fits extremely well into the Imperial fleet doctrine. Mostly produced in the shipyards of Cypra-Mundi, creating an Overlord is labour extensive and expensive, but requires no volatile or rare technologies, allowing new vessels of this class to be produced semi-regularly.",,,,
shpe_apocalypse,SHIP,"An ancient battleship design, the apocalypse offers unparalleled energy-based firepower at long ranges. Temporarily focussing reactor power on energy weapons allows the apocalypse to significantly extend its weapon range at the cost of mobility.

The apocalypse is one of the oldest ship types still in use by the Imperial Navy and is thought to be the precursor to the more modern Retribution. Nonetheless the few remaining apocalypse battleships are still formidable and in many ways more powerful than newer designs.",,,,
shpe_emperor,SHIP,"The Imperium's ultimate battlecarrier, the emperor battleship singelhandedly carries enough strike craft to support a mid-sized Imperial fleet while protecting itself with batteries of macrocannons and capital-grade armor.

The emperor exchanges the heavy adamantine prow common in imperial warships for a mass of high-powered sensors to guide and coordinate fleet operations. For this reason the emperor is favored as a flagship by many an admiral.",,,,
shpe_retribution,SHIP,"A traditional battleship, mounting a truly terrifying broadside, the retribution is the backbone of the imperial navy. Due to its ponderous size it is typically paired with a number of lighter escorts.

Most retribution battleships that are still in use were built on the ring of iron around mars.",,,,
,,,,,,
shpe_defiant_mech,SHIP,"The lightest carrier in the imperial fleet, the defiant lacks the firepower of a proper battlecarrier but can bolster the fighter capabilities of larger fleets.

This model has been modified from the original pattern for exclusive usage by the fleets of the Adeptus Mechanicus.",,,,
shpe_endurance_mech,SHIP,"Essentially an Endeavour with lance batteries in place of macrocannons, the Endurance can punch through even heavy armor but can struggle with shielded targets.

This model has been modified from the original pattern for exclusive usage by the fleets of the Adeptus Mechanicus.",,,,
shpe_endeavour_mech,SHIP,"While lacking the speed of other light cruisers, the Endeavour has the firepower and durability to hold its own in a pitched battle, making them ideal as heavy escorts or convoy flagships.

This model has been modified from the original pattern for exclusive usage by the fleets of the Adeptus Mechanicus.",,,,
,,,,,,
shpe_tyrant_mech,SHIP,"Developed late in the 38th millenium, the tyrant features a devastating broadside, designed to fit rows of plasma weapons.

This model has been modified from the original pattern for exclusive usage by the fleets of the Adeptus Mechanicus.",,,,
,,,,,,
shpe_styx,SHIP,"Mustering a considerable array of long range weapons batteries to complement its sizeable launch bays, the Styx is a much older alternative to the Mars that has been phased out by most Imperial fleets but is still used by traitors and heretics.

During the Gothic War the forces of chaos used Styx class ships against the Imperium on 39 separate occasions.",,,,
shpe_acheron,SHIP,"The acheron class is a rarity even among the forces of chaos that still use it to this day, with only one single vessel originally being constructed as a testbed for exotic new weapon systems.

Ships of this class are armed exclusively with lances or simillar weapons.",,,,
shpe_hades,SHIP,"Combining a full broadside of superfiring light macrocannons with the addition of lances to punch through armor, the hades is a feared vessel on the battlefield.

Once favored highly by the Imperial Navy, most surviving hades class heavy cruisers have fallen into the hands of the archenemy.",,,,
shpe_carnage,SHIP,"The Carnage class cruisers were designed as fleet support vessels, utilising long range gun batteries to stand off and provide supporting fire for other ships.

While largely considered an ill-fated design, the Carnage is still used to this day and can even act as an effective brawler if outfitted for close combat.",,,,
shpe_slaughter,SHIP,"The Slaughter class cruiser utilises a Scartix engine coil, that provides the ship with a thrust considerably more powerful than any other vessel's of the same size.

While the design for the Slaughter has alledgedly been lost, the continued usage of these agile vessels suggests it may have been reverse-engineered by the servants of chaos.",,,,
shpe_devastation,SHIP,"A flexible battlecarrier, the Devastation carries both lances and macrobatteries while also fielding a sizeable fighter complement.

A full-sized cruiser the Devastation is well suited for large fleet battles, but its flexibility and abillity to carry bombers for quick crippling strikes also makes it well suited for attacking transports and smaller convoys.",,,,
shpe_devastation_tzeentch_daemon,SHIP,WIP,,,,
,,,,,,
shpe_fury_mech,SHIP,"Flexible and well-armed, the Fury is the Imperial Navy's main Interceptor craft. While it can also attack larger ships it lacks the punch to truly threaten them, but excells at destroying torpedos and strikecraft.

This model has been modified from the original pattern for exclusive usage by the fleets of the Adeptus Mechanicus.

",,,,
shpe_starhawk_mech,SHIP,"Sturdy and heavily armed, the Starhawk carries both bombs and missiles, making it a threat to much large warhships, especially if their shields are down. While it is also capable of defending itself against missiles and other fighters, it fares best with an escort.

This model has been modified from the original pattern for exclusive usage by the fleets of the Adeptus Mechanicus.",,,,
shpe_lunar_mech,SHIP,"Flexible and powerful, the Lunar works well in almost any fleet composition and at all ranges of engagement. Larger Imperial fleets will often feature multiple Lunars for their sheer flexibility.

shpe_darkstar,SHIP,"A tough and agile fighter, the darkstar excels at fighting hostile attack craft but can also do some damage to larger ships while being more survivable than other erldar ships of its size.",,,,
shpe_eagle,SHIP,"Favored by eldar corsairs, the eagle is a fast and powerful bomber. Using its sonic charges a single eagle can deal more damage to a capital ship than s squadron of lesser bombers.",,,,
shpe_hemlock,SHIP,"A psychic fighter craft, each hemlock wraithfighter is piloted by a powerful spiritseer. The ultimate terror weapon of the craftworlds, using this fighter is seen by some as an atrocity.

The hemlock mounts two heavy D-scythes, terrifying disruption weapons that are considered frobidden by more traditionalist eldar, while the mindshock pod integrated into its hull allows the pilot to project their psychic might outside the vehicle, disabling or even destroying enemy craft.",,,,
shpe_nightshade,SHIP,"A highly specialized interceptor, the nightshade is used exclusively by aspect warriors of the Crimson Hunters. The nightshade's exceptional agillity and increased firepower over other eldar interceptors makes it unrivaled in fighter-to-fighter combat.",,,,

",,,,
,,,,,,
shpe_lasburner,WEAPON,"A scaled-down version of a true lance, very capable of cutting through armor for its size.",,,,
shpe_mezoa_lance,WEAPON,"A short ranged lance that deals devastating damage.

This recent design from Mezoa remains controversial since it doesn't fit into the traditional Imperial navy doctrine.",,,,
shpe_banefire_lance,WEAPON,"This long-ranged lance fires in a lethal rapid burst but is slow to recharge while having a massive power draw.

While it is still rarely seen on older Imperial vessels, this weapons is predominantly used by renegades nowadays.",,,,
shpe_heavy_voidsunder_lance,WEAPON,"A modular-mounted variant of a heavy lance that would normally be mounted as an underslung prow weapon on a light cruiser, this lance deals massive damage on a slow recharge.",,,,
