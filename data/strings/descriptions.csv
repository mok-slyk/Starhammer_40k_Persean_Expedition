shpe_fury,SHIP,"Flexible and well-armed, the Fury is the Imperial Navy's main Interceptor craft. While it can also attack larger ships it lacks the punch to truly threaten them, but excells at destroying torpedos and strikecraft.

While it is larger and heavier and heavier than most fightercraft, including its predecessor, the Wrath, the Fury handles suprisingly well and can easily match the speed of the larger Starhawk-Bombers it waas designed to escort in battle.

",,,,
shpe_starhawk,SHIP,"Sturdy and heavily armed, the Starhawk carries both bombs and missiles, making it a threat to much large warhships, especially if their shields are down. While it is also capable of defending itself against missiles and other fighters, it fares best with an escort.",,,,
shpe_defiant,SHIP,"The lightest carrier in the imperial fleet, the defiant lacks the firepower of a proper battlecarrier but can bolster the fighter capabilities of larger fleets.

Defiants are the rarest ship of the Voss triumvirate as they are seen as too vulnerable to operate on their own, nonetheless they are a powerful tool in the hands of a capable admiral and have proven themselves especially against fleets lacking strikecraft of their own.",,,,
shpe_endurance,SHIP,"Essentially an Endeavour with lance batteries in place of macrocannons, the Endurance can punch through even heavy armor but can struggle with shielded targets.

A common Imperial Navy practise is to pair up an Edurance with one to three Endeavours, creating a powerful squadron that can handily deal with much larger opponents.",,,,
shpe_endeavour,SHIP,"While lacking the speed of other light cruisers, the Endeavour has the firepower and durability to hold its own in a pitched battle, making them ideal as heavy escorts or convoy flagships.

The cheapest and most common of the Voss triumvirate, the Endeavour is often employed by Imperial fleets to replace lost cruisers as a campaign drags on and larger vessels come into short supply.",,,,
shpe_lunar,SHIP,"Flexible and powerful, the Lunar works well in almost any fleet composition and at all ranges of engagement. Larger Imperial fleets will often feature multiple Lunars for their sheer flexibility.

Lunar cruisers are not only powerful but also cheap and easy to produce, allowing even worlds that could not normally construct full-blown cruisers to build them with only rudimentary orbital works. Because of this, Lunars are the most common type of cruiser in the Imperium and maybe even in the galaxy at large.

",,,,
shpe_gothic,SHIP,"A familliar sight throughout the galaxy, the Gothic features one of the largest lance broadsides in the Imperium, allowing it to quickly destroy even larger opponents if given the chance. Due to its lack of macrobatteries the Gothic works best if supported by other warhsips, allowing it to bring the full force of its lances to bear.

The Gothic is the second most common Imperial cruiser after the Lunar and is commonly used in larger fleet engagements, where if properly supported it can threaten even grand cruisers and battleships.",,,,
shpe_dictator,SHIP,"Originally developed from damaged Lunars for Orbital assaults, the Dictator has since become an ubiquitous and capable battlecarrier.

While the Dictator was originally an experimental retrofit, it has since become one of the main cruisers of the Imperial Navy, often being used as the flagship of larger anti-piracy patrols for its abillity to easily deal with small to medium sized enemies.

",,,,
shpe_dominator,SHIP,"Designed and built around its prow-mounted novacannon, the Dominator is the lightes Imperial Navy vessel to employ this type of terrifying artillery. While it excels al long ranged fire support, the Dominator can also hold its own at knivefighting distances due to its massive macrobattery broadsides.

Most Dominators are constructed and deployed in the Ultima Segmentum, making them very rare in the rest of Imperial space.",,,,
shpe_armageddon,SHIP,"Typically created from the hulks of ruined Lunar cruisers, the Armageddon is a relatively recent innovation for the Imperial Navy, featuring devastating firepower while being comparatively cheap to produce.

Due to their somewhat improvised nature, Armageddon Battlecruisers have suprisingly cramped internals while requiring a vast amount of crew, making them rare in expeditionary fleets and the possesion of rogue traders. For the Imperial Navy however, these downsides are negligible and the Armageddon is probably the most common battlecruiser in the Imperium.",,,,
shpe_mars,SHIP,"The ultimalte ""all rounder"" of the Imperial Navy, the Mars-Battlecruiser features a combination of Lance weapons and Macrobatteries, fighter bays and the devastation novacannon, all on the frame of a cruiser. While it can hold its own in most combat scenarios, the Mars excells in a long-ranged support role, pummeling enemies at range with bombers and nova shells.

Due to changing navy doctrine, Mars Battlecruisers are only produced in very limited quantities nowadays. Nonetheless both navy admirals and rogue traders favor the Mars for its versatility and long ranged power.",,,,
shpe_overlord,SHIP,"A combat ship in its purest form, the Overlord relies on uncomplicated macrobatteries and torpedos, supllementing them with dorsal lances to cut through enemy armor.

While it is one of the oldest Imperial battlecruiser designs, the Overlord still finds heavy use in the Imperial navy, as it fits extremely well into the Imperial fleet doctrine. Mostly produced in the shipyards of Cypra-Mundi, creating an Overlord is labour extensive and expensive, but requires no volatile or rare technologies, allowing new vessels of this class to be produced semi-regularly.",,,,
shpe_apocalypse,SHIP,"An ancient battleship design, the apocalypse offers unparalleled energy-based firepower at long ranges. Temporarily focussing reactor power on energy weapons allows the apocalypse to significantly extend its weapon range at the cost of mobility.

The apocalypse is one of the oldest ship types still in use by the Imperial Navy and is thought to be the precursor to the more modern Retribution. Nonetheless the few remaining apocalypse battleships are still formidable and in many ways more powerful than newer designs.",,,,
shpe_emperor,SHIP,"The Imperium's ultimate battlecarrier, the emperor battleship singelhandedly carries enough strike craft to support a mid-sized Imperial fleet while protecting itself with batteries of macrocannons and capital-grade armor.

The emperor exchanges the heavy adamantine prow common in imperial warships for a mass of high-powered sensors to guide and coordinate fleet operations. For this reason the emperor is favored as a flagship by many an admiral.",,,,
shpe_retribution,SHIP,"A traditional battleship, mounting a truly terrifying broadside, the retribution is the backbone of the imperial navy. Due to its ponderous size it is typically paired with a number of lighter escorts.

Most retribution battleships that are still in use were built on the ring of iron around mars.",,,,
,,,,,,
shpe_fury_mech,SHIP,"Flexible and well-armed, the Fury is the Imperial Navy's main Interceptor craft. While it can also attack larger ships it lacks the punch to truly threaten them, but excells at destroying torpedos and strikecraft.

While it is larger and heavier and heavier than most fightercraft, including its predecessor, the Wrath, the Fury handles suprisingly well and can easily match the speed of the larger Starhawk-Bombers it waas designed to escort in battle.

shpe_darkstar,SHIP,"A tough and agile fighter, the darkstar excels at fighting hostile attack craft but can also do some damage to larger ships while being more survivable than other erldar ships of its size.",,,,
shpe_eagle,SHIP,"Favored by eldar corsairs, the eagle is a fast and powerful bomber. Using its sonic charges a single eagle can deal more damage to a capital ship than s squadron of lesser bombers.",,,,
shpe_hemlock,SHIP,"A psychic fighter craft, each hemlock wraithfighter is piloted by a powerful spiritseer. The ultimate terror weapon of tzhe craftworlds, using this fighter is seen by some as an atrocity.

The hemlock mounts two heavy D-scythes, terrifying disruption weapons that are considered frobidden by more traditionalist eldar, while the mindshock pod integrated into its hull allows the pilot to project their psychic might outside the vehicle, disabling or even destroying enemy craft.",,,,
shpe_nightshade,SHIP,"A highly specialized interceptor, the nightshade is used exclusively by aspect warriors of the Crimson Hunters. The nightshade's unrivaled agillity and increased firepower over other eldar interceptors makes it unrivaled in fighter-to-fighter combat.",,,,
shpe_manta,SHIP,"A massive gunship rivaling the size and firepower of some escort craft, the manta can take on entire squadrons of lesser fighters while its titan-grade weaponry can threaten larger voidcraft.",,,,
shpe_tigershark,SHIP,"An unconventional fighter-bomber, the tigershark can release a swarm of tiny gun drones to verwhelm enemy defenses while its smart missiles and ion cannons punish larger ships.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
shpe_bolter,WEAPON,"A rapid-firing point defense weapon firing rocket-propelled mass-reactive shells. Originally designed for use on the ground it has plenty of destructive power to destroy torpedos and strikecraft but a lacks the accuracy to reliably hit faster missiles and fighters.

An infantry variant of this weapon is commonly used by the Astartes and their warships most commonly feature this weapon as point defense.",,,,
shpe_marsnova,WEAPON,"A powerful artillery cannon firing an explosive round at relativistic speeds over incredible distances. Once the shell explodes it creates a massive blastwave, potentially hitting multiple enemy ships.

Nova shells are higly voaltile and relatively inaccurate. Once they are fired the exact point of explosion is unpredictable.",,,,
shpe_ryzanova,WEAPON,"A powerful artillery cannon firing a plasma round at relativistic speeds over incredible distances. Once the shell explodes it creates a massive cloud of superheated plasma, potentially hitting multiple enemy ships in an even larger area than other novacannons.

Nova shells are higly voaltile and relatively inaccurate. Once they are fired the exact point of explosion is unpredictable.",,,,
shpe_titanforge_lance,WEAPON,"A long raged lance weapon that can rapidly cut through even heavy armor. The Titanforge-Pattern of lance is the most common in the Imperium.

The weapon's high range, precision and instantaneous firing time allows it to punish enemies that drop their shields even if the do so only for an instance.",,,,
shpe_marsvi_builtin,WEAPON,"A medium ranged artillery piece firing heavy shells for consistent kinetic damage. The most common and reliable type of macrocannon.

The Mars VI-Pattern macrocannon can be found on the broadsides of most Imperial warships.",,,,
shpe_vulcan,WEAPON,"A rapid-firing bolt weapon that saturates the void with enough rounds to shred entire squadrons of strikecraft.

 Megabolters are typically seen on super-heavy ground vehicles but this is a rare starship-mounted variant.",,,,
shpe_starbreaker_lance,WEAPON,"A relatively light and cheap lance that performs acceptably against both armor and shields. Originally an unsuccessful attempt at replicating the success of the Titanforge.

Not as powerful as other lances but cheap in infrastructure and flux, making it common on lighter vessels.",,,,
shpe_stygies_reference,WEAPON,"A macrocannon firing an uncommonly heavy, admamantium-reinforced shell that takes long to reload and reach its target but deals devastating damage.

Uses linear accelerators to fire its titanic shell, originally designed to reduce planetary defenses to rubble.",,,,
shpe_hecutor_reference,WEAPON,"An ancient type of macrocannon firing not ballistic shells but balls of concentrated plasma over vast distances.

Rarely seen in modern Imperial fleets outside of older vessels.",,,,
shpe_pyros_reference,WEAPON,"A type of heavy macrocannon firing shells tipped with melta-charges to punch through heavy armor.

Able to deal with much heavier armor than other macrocannons.",,,,
shpe_disruptor_reference,WEAPON,"A macrocannon firing a ""shell"" of charged deuterium particles that disable enemy systems and weaponry.

Particularly useful for disabling instead of destryong a target but also commonly used to set up a clean kill.",,,,
shpe_plasmatorp_reference,WEAPON,"A long-ranged unguided torpedo equipped with a versatile plasma warhead.

Commonly used as both a first-strike weapon and to finish of crippled targets.",,,,
shpe_meltatorp_reference,WEAPON,"A long-ranged unguided torpedo equipped with a powerful melta warhead, capable of burning away thick armor.

Devastates targets without shields but struggles against shielded targets.
",,,,
shpe_barragetorp_reference,WEAPON,"An orbital bombardment torpedo that can also be used against starships, saturating a slim cone of space with smaller bomblets.

Splits into many submunitions when it comes close to the target.

",,,,
shpe_seekingtorp_reference,WEAPON,"A long range torpedo with a weak guidance system. Slightly less damage than other comparable torpedos due to space required by the guidance.

Seen as unreliable and weak by some but nonetheless commonly used in the Imperial Navy.
",,,,
shpe_vortextorp_reference,WEAPON,"A rare long range torpedo equipped with a terrifying vortex warhead.

Rips a hole in space itself, creating a short live gateway to the immaterium and dealing massive damage in a small area.",,,,

One of the rarest types of Imperial macroweaponry.",,,,
shpe_shard_reference,WEAPON,"An alien weapon firing shards of strange crystal without consuming ammo or energy.

The original creators of this weapon are long forgotten and likely extinct.",,,,
shpe_joviannova,WEAPON,"A powerful artillery cannon firing extremely rare vortex shells that tear open realspace, dealing massive damage albeit in a comparatively small area.

Rarely if ever used by the Imperium, both because of their age and arrity and because of the dangers of storing many vortex shells in the Prow of a warship.",,,,
shpe_lascannon,WEAPON,"A rapid firing beam weapon that can hit torpedos and fighters with unrivaled accuracy. 

Deals nominally limited damage but is rather effective nonetheless due to its precision.",,,,
